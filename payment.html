ApnaStyle uses 256-bit encryption technology to protect your card information while securely transmitting it to the respective banks for payment processing.<br><br>
            
            All credit card and debit card payments on ApnaStyle are processed through secure and trusted payment gateways managed by leading banks. Banks now use the 3D Secure password service for online transactions, providing an additional layer of security through identity verification.<br><br>
            
            What steps does ApnaStyle take to prevent card fraud?<br>
            Flipkart realizes the importance of a strong fraud detection and resolution capability. We and our online payments partners monitor transactions continuously for suspicious activity and flag potentially fraudulent transactions for manual verification by our team.<br><br>
            
            In the rarest of rare cases, when our team is unable to rule out the possibility of fraud categorically, the transaction is kept on hold, and the customer is requested to provide identity documents. The ID documents help us ensure that the purchases were indeed made by a genuine card holder. We apologise for any inconvenience that may be caused to customers and request them to bear with us in the larger interest of ensuring a safe and secure environment for online transactions.<br><br>
            
            <h3>What is a 3D Secure password?</h3><br>
            The 3D Secure password is implemented by VISA and MasterCard in partnership with card issuing banks under the "Verified by VISA" and "Mastercard SecureCode" services, respectively.<br><br>
            
            The 3D Secure password adds an additional layer of security through identity verification for your online credit/debit card transactions. This password, which is created by you, is known only to you. This ensures that only you can use your card for online purchases.<br><br>
            
            <h3>How can I get the 3D Secure password for my credit/debit card?</h3><br>
            You can register for the 3D Secure password for your credit/debit card by visiting your bank's website. The registration links for some of the banks have been provided below for easy reference:<br><br>
