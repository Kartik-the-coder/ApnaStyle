        <h3><b>DELIVERY RELATED</b></h3><br>
        <h3>1. I still haven't received my order. Where is my order?</h3><br>
        Hey there! Our standard delivery timeline is between 10-15 business days, which includes the order processing time and delivery time. It may vary slightly depending on the location. Please allow us this period to deliver your order and we promise you it's gonna be worth the wait.
        <h3>2. Why is there a delay in the delivery?</h3><br>
        If it is taking more time than expected to deliver your order, there is a possibility that we unfortunately have some logistical issues due to which your order was not able to be delivered to you on time. Again, this happens very rarely and only for a very few products which come from an international warehouse. We are really apologetic for the same but we request you to please give us 5-7 days more and we shall be taking care of this. We promise you it's going to be worth the wait.
        <h3>3. My order got cancelled, why?</h3><br>
        We strive to deliver the complete order in the same way you have placed and to absolute perfection so it makes you not only look good but feel good. However, sometimes due to high demand for a product, it can potentially become out of stock more quickly than we imagine and sometimes we might have to cancel due to quality issues etc. Please be assured that this happens very rarely and we are constantly improving our processes to help make your experience pleasant with us.
        <h3>4. What is a split order?</h3>
        When you select a few products from “Fast” delivery and few from “Standard” delivery under one order, the order will be split into 2 different shipments after the order is placed. You will be making the payment together for all the products but since the delivery timelines are different, the order will be delivered separately.
        <h3>5. Why did the attempted delivery fail?</h3>
        There may be different possible reasons for the delivery to fail while attempted by courier partners.<br><br>
        1.Wrong and incomplete address<br><br>
        2.Consignee Unavailable/Incorrect Phone Number<br><br>
        3.Entry Restricted Area<br><br>
        4.No payment made during delivery (For COD Orders)<br><br>
        5.Consignee moved/shifted Please note, the order will be returned if the delivery fails on 3 attempts.<br><br>
